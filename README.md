# ThesisCode
Code that I used when working on my senior thesis

First, MARLEY must be downloaded from http://www.marleygen.org/ .

Follow setup instructions from the Getting Started page.

Then the files in this repository's build folder should be downloaded into the build directory.

e.g. /marley-1.2.0/build/gkvm.js
